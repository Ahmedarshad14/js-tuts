// Primitive Data Types or value Types
    // they are always called by value, 
    // store only one value.
    // string, number, boolean, undefined, null, bigint, symbol

// Non Primitive or Reference Types

    // Arrays, Objects, Functions

// JS is dynamically typed language, as it never ask you for type safety or type conversions, type assignments.

// typeof bigint


// Stack Memory &  Heap Memory

// Stack memory is used for all primitive types. We receive a copy whenever we access the variable.

// Heap memory is used for all reference types. we receive a reference of original value so if we make any change, it will be changed in original value.
